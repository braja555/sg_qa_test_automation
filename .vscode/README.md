Test Automation Framework for SkyGuard

1. Overview

The test automation framework is designed to provide a robust, scalable and feature-rich solution for auotmated testing of the Skyguard applications. The framework encomposses various features, including data-driven testing, logging, retry mechanism, corss-browser testing, mulitple environments, code quality, CI/CD integration, reusablility utilities and parallel testing.

2. Feautre

2.1 Page Object Model(POM) Implementation

Ojective: Apply POM principle to structure the code and make resuable & maintainable code.

2.2 Data-Driven Testing

Objective: Enhance test coverage by parameterizing tests with external data

2.3 Logging

Objective: Provid comprehenisve logs for detailed test execution analsyis.

2.4 Retry Mechanism

Objective: Handle interminttent failures gracefully with automatic retries.

2.5 Cross-Browser Testing

Objective: Validate application functionality across different browsers.

2.6 Mulitiple Environments

Objective: Securely manage and use passwords in test scenarios.

2.7 Code Quality

Objective: Enforce coding standards and maintain high-quality standard.

2.8 CI/CD Integration

Objective: Seamlessly integrate the framework with CI/CD pipeliine

2.9 Reusable Utilities

Objective: Develop modular and reusable utitlities to optimize code maintenance.

2.10 Data Generation

Objective: Generate test data dynamically to ensure diverse test scenarios.

2.11 Parallel Testing

Objective: Execute tests concurrently for faster feedback and optimized test suits execution

2.12 API Mocking/Testing

Objective: To be implemented (Mock and test application API'S to validate backend functionality).

2.13 Encrypt Sensitive Credentials

Objective: To be implmented (This will allow to secure our test data in any environment).
